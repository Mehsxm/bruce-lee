           <p class="life-header bold">Timeline of Bruce Lee's Life:
           </p>
           <ul id="tribute-info">
            <li><span class="bold">On November 27, 1940,</span> the actor and martial-arts expert Bruce Lee is born in San Francisco, California. Lee was born while his father, a Chinese opera star, was on tour in America.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">In 1941,</span> the Lee family moved to Hong Kong. Growing up, Lee was a child actor who appeared in some 20 Chinese films; he also studied dancing and trained in the Wing Chun style of gung fu.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">In 1959,</span> Lee returned to America, where he eventually attended the University of Washington and opened a martial-arts school in Seattle.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">In 1964,</span> he married Linda Emery, who in 1965 gave birth to Brandon Lee, the first of the couple’s two children.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">In 1966,</span> the Lees relocated to Los Angeles and Bruce appeared on the television program The Green Hornet (1966-1967), playing the Hornet’s acrobatic sidekick, Kato. Lee also appeared in karate tournaments around the United States and continued to teach martial arts to private clients, including the actor Steve McQueen. </li>
            <li><span class="bold">In 1967,</span> Washington, D.C. – Bruce meets Joe Lewis at The Mayflower Hotel while both were guests at the 67′ National Karate Championships. Joe is competing in the tournament and Bruce is making special appearances as Kato. Bruce opens a 3rd school at 628 College Street, Los Angeles, CA. Dan Inosanto serves as assistant instructor.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">In 1969,</span> Santa Monica, California Shannon Lee is born, daughter of Bruce Lee. Bruce injures his sacral nerve lifting weights and experiences severe muscle spasms in his back. Doctors told him that he would never kick again. They were wrong, but Lee suffered pain almost constantly. During the months of recovery he starts to document his training methods and his philosophy of Jeet Kune Do. Later published as The Tao of Jeet Kune Do.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">In 1970,</span> Bruce goes to Hong Kong and is welcomed by fans of The Green Hornet. Bruce sends Unicorn to talk to Run Run Shaw on his behalf and inform Shaw that he would be willing to do a movie for him for $10K. Shaw makes counter-offer of a seven year contract and $2K per film which Bruce declines.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">In 1971,</span> Bruce, James Coburn, Stirling Silliphant fly to India to scout locations for The Silent Flute. They spend one month searching but are forced to call off the search as Coburn backs out of the project. This trip gives Bruce the idea for Game of Death, where a fighter, mastering in several techniques, will go from one level to the next in a temple: the first level (the level of weaponry), the second level (the level of the nine degree black belt), and the third level ( “The level of the unknown.”)</li>
            <li>Bruce takes a short trip back to Hong Kong to arrange for his mother to live in the U.S. Unknowingly to him, he had become a superstar for The Green Hornet, and was one of the most popular TV shows in Hong Kong. Later, he is approached by Raymond Chow, owner of a new production company, and offered the lead role in a new film called The Big Boss. Bruce accepts. Bruce is supplied with a small apartment at 2 Man Wan Road – Kowloon, Hong Kong. Brandon attends La Salle College. The same school Bruce attended only 15 years before. Bruce is interviewed by Canadian talk show host Pierre Berton for a TV program being filmed in Hong Kong.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">In July 1971,</span> Filming begins for The Big Boss (released in the U.S. as Fists of Fury). The Big Boss opens in Hong Kong to great reviews and mobs of fans. Proceeds to gross more than $3.5 million in little than three weeks.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">In December 1971,</span> Bruce receives a telegram, notifying him that he had not been chosen for the part in the upcoming series, The Warrior. This series was later released as Kung-Fu, staring David Caradine, as the studios felt that the American public would not accept an Asian in a leading role on television.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">In 1972,</span> Fist of Fury (released in the U.S. as The Chinese Connection) is released. It grosses more than The Big Boss and further establishes Bruce as a Hong Kong superstar. Bruce gets a larger budget, a larger salary, and more power of directing in this film. Bruce begins work on Game of Death and films several fight scenes including Dan Inosanto and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Bruce appears on Hong Kong’s TVB channel for a hurricane disaster relief. In a demo Bruce performs, he breaks 4 out of 5 boards, one of which is hanging in the air with a line of string.</li>
            <li>Location shots are made for Bruce’s third film The Way of the Dragon (released in the U.S. as The Return of the Dragon). This time Bruce gets almost complete control the movie, which he writes, directs, and stars. Chuck Norris is Bruce’s adversary in the final fight scene. Again, this film surpasses all records set by his previous two films.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">In February 1973,</span> Bruce gets his chance at American stardom as filming of Enter the Dragon begins while Game of Death is put on hold. It is the first-ever production between the U.S. and Hong Kong film industries. On February 20, Bruce is guest of honor at St. Francis Xavier’s school for Sports Day ceremonies.</li>
            <li>Bruce orders all three of his Jeet Kune Do schools closed in six months. He did not approve of some teaching methods in his absence and he felt others were taking advantage of him in some way. Hong Kong – Filming of Enter the Dragon is completed. Bruce is at Golden Harvest Studios in Hong Kong dubbing his voice for “Enter The Dragon”. The air conditioners had been turned off, so the microphones won’t pick them up. The temperature soared. Bruce takes a break looping lines to go to the bathroom and splash water on his face. In he bathroom, he passes out on the bathroom floor. He revives twenty minutes later just as assistant sent to find out what was keeping him walks in and discovers him on the ground. He tries to conceal his collapse by acting as though he has dropped his glasses on the floor and is searching for them and is helped up by the assistant. As they are walking back to the dubbing room, Bruce collapses again and is rushed to a nearby hospital.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">On July 10th 1973,</span> Bruce Lee is walking through the Golden Harvest Studios and overhears Lo Wei in a nearby room bad mouthing him. He confronts Lo Wei who retreats and summons the local police. When the police arrive Lo Wei falsely accuses Bruce of threatened him with a knife concealed in his belt buckle. He further insists that Bruce sign a statement that he will not harm him. Bruce signs the statement to get Lo Wei off his back although Lo Wei lied to the police and Bruce never had a knife nor threatened to kill him. That same day, Bruce appears on the Hong Kong TV show, Enjoy Yourself Tonight with host Ho Sho Shin. Bruce alludes to his problems with director Lo Wei, but does not mention him by name. Bruce is asked to display his physical prowess and demonstrates his abilities. Bruce demonstrates a technique and Shin is knocked across the stage.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">On July 16th 1973,</span> Heavy rains fall caused by a typhoon off the coast of Hong Kong. Bruce makes a $200 phone call to speak to Unicorn in his hotel room, who is filming a movie in Manila. Bruce tells Unicorn that he is worried about the many headaches he is experiencing.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">On July 20th 1973,</span> Early that morning Bruce types a letter to his attorney, Adrian Marshall, detailing business ventures he wants to discuss on his upcoming trip to Los Angeles. Bruce had tickets already set to return to the US for a publicity tour and was scheduled to appear on the Johnny Carson show. Raymond Chow goes by Bruce’s house and the two discuss plans for their upcoming movie Game of Death. Linda kisses Bruce good-bye and says she is going out to run some errands and will see him later that night. Raymond and Bruce visit Betty Ting Pei at her apartment to discuss her role in Game of Death. That evening, plans had been made for them all to meet George Lazenby over dinner and enlist him for a part. Bruce explains that he has a headache, takes a prescription pain killer offered by Betty, and lies down on her bed to rest prior to dinner. Raymond Chow departs and says that he will meet them later. Raymond Chow and George Lazenby meet at a restaurant and await Bruce and Betty’s arrival, but the two never show up. At 9:00 p.m. Chow receives a call from Betty; she said that she has tried to wake Bruce up but he isn't responding. Betty summons her personal physician who fails to revive Bruce and who has Bruce taken to the hospital. Bruce does not revive and is pronounced dead. Bruce Lee dies in Hong Kong of an apparent cerebral edema (swelling of the brain). Doctors declared the death of Bruce Lee as “death by misadventure.” The premier of Enter the Dragon was pushed back by four days due to the actors death.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">On July 25th 1973,</span> A funeral ceremony is held for Bruce Lee in Hong Kong, over 25,000 people were in attendance. Bruce is dressed in the Hifu he wore in Enter the Dragon.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">On July 30th 1973,</span> After a smaller second ceremony in Seattle, Washington at Butterworth Funeral Home on East Pine Street, Bruce Lee is buried at Lake View Cemetery. His pallbearers included Steve McQueen, James Coburn, Dan Inosanto, Taky Kimura, Peter Chin, and Robert Lee his brother.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">On August 24th 1973,</span> Enter The Dragon premiers at Graumann’s Chinese Theater, California. The profits were astronomical, with Enter the Dragon reportedly grossing $100,000,000 worldwide upon its initial release.</li>
